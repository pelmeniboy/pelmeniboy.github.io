I am a scientist, with formal training is in Biochemistry and Computer Science, and a PhD in Computational Biology from Cornell. After completing my graduate studies I joined KSQ Therapeutics where I leveraged CRISPR screening for target discovery and supported two clinical-stage programs using small molecule and gene-edited cell modalities. I am a passionate and curious scientist, and believe that my greatest strengths are a balanced perfectionism with pragmatism, willingness to leave ego aside, ability to work toward big solutions in small steps and iterate.
