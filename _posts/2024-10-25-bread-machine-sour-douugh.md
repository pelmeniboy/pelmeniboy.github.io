This is a recipe for sour dough.my family loves to eat bread, but we never buy bread ffrom the store. thats because we have a fail proof family recipe that makes delicous sour dough bread. 


the grate thing about this recipe is that it is zeoro fus, it requires no manual kneading, and very litille hands on attention. the trickto makeing it easy is to use a bread machine. originally, my dad was makeing this recipe by hand, but my mom decidet he was spending too much time makeing bread, so for Christmas santa brough him a fancy Zojirushi bread macanhine. the machine can do all the the kneading, and can even be programmed to automatically bake your bread so it is ready when you woke up in the morning. 

Here is the recipe:
